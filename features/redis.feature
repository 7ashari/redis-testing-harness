Feature: Redis Tests

  Scenario: Verify cache set and get operations
    Given Redis is running
    When I set a key "name" with value "copilot"
    Then I should be able to get the value "copilot" for the key "name"

  Scenario: Test data persistence
    Given Redis is running
    When I set a key "language" with value "python"
    And I restart the Redis server
    Then I should be able to get the value "python" for the key "language"

  Scenario: Simulate failover scenario
    Given Redis is running with a replica
    When the master node fails
    Then the replica should take over as the master

  Scenario: Verify key expiration
    Given Redis is running
    When I set a key "session" with value "active" and expiration of 5 seconds
    Then after 6 seconds the key "session" should not exist

  Scenario: Test handling of large data structures
    Given Redis is running
    When I add 1000 items to a list "mylist"
    Then the length of the list "mylist" should be 1000

  Scenario: Execute Lua script
    Given Redis is running
    When I execute a Lua script to set and get a key "script_key" with value "script_value"
    Then I should be able to get the value "script_value" for the key "script_key"

  Scenario: Performance test with redis-benchmark
    Given Redis is running
    When I run the redis-benchmark tool
    Then the results should show the performance metrics
